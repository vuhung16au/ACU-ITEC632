This project demonstrates Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using the Pokemon dataset to classify Pokemon types based on their base stats. LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that finds linear combinations of features to maximize class separability.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a powerful technique that serves two main purposes:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of features while preserving class separability
- **Classification**: Provides a linear classifier based on the transformed features

Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which focuses on maximizing variance, LDA specifically aims to maximize the separability between different classes in the data.

rmarkdown::render("Linear-Discriminant-Analysis.Rmd")
```

## 📊 What You'll Get

The analysis will generate:

1. **Console Output**: Progress messages and results
2. **Visualizations**: 7 PNG files in the `images/` directory
3. **Model Objects**: LDA model and transformed data
4. **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy and confusion matrix

### Generated Visualizations

- **Sample Data LDA**: Demonstrates LDA on synthetic, well-separated data
- **LDA Coefficients**: Shows feature importance across discriminants
- **Pokemon Projections**: Visualizes Pokemon types in LDA space
- **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluates classification performance
- **Correlation Matrix**: Shows relationships between different stats
- **Feature Importance**: Ranks features by their discriminative power

## 🔍 Analysis Components

### 1. Sample Data Demonstration
- Generates synthetic data with three well-separated classes
- Shows LDA's effectiveness on ideal data
- Demonstrates the transformation process

### 2. Pokemon Dataset Analysis
- **Dataset**: 800+ Pokemon with single types
- **Features**: 6 base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed)
- **Target**: Pokemon type classification
- **Classes**: 18 different Pokemon types

### 3. LDA Implementation
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LDA model fitting using the `MASS` package
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance evaluation

### 4. Visualization and Interpretation
- Coefficient heatmaps
- Projection plots
- Confusion matrices
- Statistical summaries

## 📈 Key Results

### Sample Data
- **Perfect Separation**: Three classes are completely separable in LDA space
- **Clear Discriminants**: Linear discriminants capture class differences
- **Elliptical Boundaries**: 95% confidence ellipses show class distributions

### Pokemon Dataset
- **Overall Accuracy**: Approximately 30-40%
- **Feature Importance**: Speed and Attack are most discriminative
- **Class Separability**: Moderate to poor separation
- **Key Insight**: Pokemon types cannot be easily predicted from base stats alone

## 🛠️ Customization

The script can be easily modified for:

- **Different Datasets**: Change the data loading section
- **Feature Selection**: Modify the features used for analysis
- **Visualization**: Adjust plot parameters and styles
- **Analysis Depth**: Add or remove analysis components

### Example: Using Your Own Data

```r
# Replace the Pokemon data loading with your own data
your_data <- read.csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Modify feature selection
features <- c("feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "target")
data_subset <- your_data[, features]

# Update feature names for visualization
feature_names <- c("Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3")
```

## 📚 Understanding LDA

### Mathematical Foundation

LDA finds the optimal projection that maximizes the Fisher criterion:


\[
J(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{S}_B \mathbf{w}}{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{S}_W \mathbf{w}}
\]


Where:
- $S_B$ is the between-class scatter matrix
- $S_W$ is the within-class scatter matrix
- $w$ is the projection vector

### Assumptions

1. **Multivariate Normal Distribution**: Each class follows a normal distribution
2. **Equal Covariance Matrices**: All classes have the same covariance structure
3. **Linear Relationships**: Classes can be separated by linear boundaries

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**
- Simple and interpretable
- Computationally efficient
- Works well with small sample sizes
- Provides probabilistic predictions

**Limitations:**
- Assumes linear separability
- Requires Gaussian distributions
- Equal covariance assumption may not hold in practice
- Limited to linear decision boundaries
