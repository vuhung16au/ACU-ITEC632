# Data Ethics and Bias Analysis Module

## Overview

This module demonstrates how algorithmic bias can be systematically introduced, detected, and mitigated in machine learning models, with specific focus on Australian legal compliance requirements. We analyze a simulated loan application dataset to identify discriminatory patterns and implement fairness strategies.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. **Identify Bias Patterns**: Recognize direct and indirect discrimination in datasets
2. **Detect Algorithmic Bias**: Use statistical methods to measure disparities across protected groups
3. **Implement Mitigation Strategies**: Apply fairness constraints and bias reduction techniques
4. **Assess Legal Compliance**: Evaluate models against Australian anti-discrimination laws
5. **Conduct Ethical Audits**: Perform comprehensive bias impact assessments

## 📊 Dataset Description

The `loan_data_sim.csv` dataset contains 2,000 simulated loan applications with:

- **Protected Attributes**: Gender, age, ethnicity, postcode (location)
- **Legitimate Factors**: Income, credit score, employment history, debt ratio
- **Proxy Variables**: Education, marital status, occupation (correlated with protected attributes)
- **Target Variable**: Loan approval decision (YES/NO)

### Bias Patterns Demonstrated

- **Gender Bias**: Female applicants have ~16% lower approval rates
- **Age Bias**: Applicants over 65 face ~20% lower approval rates  
- **Racial Bias**: African American applicants have ~26% lower approval rates
- **Intersectional Bias**: Female African American applicants face compounded discrimination
- **Proxy Discrimination**: Location and education variables create indirect bias

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "yardstick", "rpart", 
                   "gridExtra", "VIM", "knitr"))
```

### Running the Analysis

1. **Generate Dataset** (if needed):
```r
source("generate_dataset.R")
```

2. **Run Main Analysis**:
```r
source("DataEthics_Analysis.R")
```

3. **Generate Report**:
```r
rmarkdown::render("DataEthics_Analysis.Rmd")
```

## 📈 Analysis Components

### 1. Data Audit & Bias Detection
- Missing value analysis
- Disparity analysis across protected groups
- Intersectional bias assessment
- Statistical significance testing

### 2. Algorithmic Bias Demonstration
- Training biased vs. fair models
- Group-specific performance metrics
- Fairness metric calculations
- Performance disparity visualization

### 3. Mitigation & Compliance
- Protected attribute removal
- Demographic parity analysis
- Equalized odds assessment
- Australian legal compliance evaluation

## ⚖️ Australian Legal Framework

This module addresses compliance with:

- **Privacy Act 1988**: Data collection and use principles
- **Anti-Discrimination Acts**: Direct and indirect discrimination prohibitions
- **Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986**: Equality and non-discrimination rights
- **Fair Lending Guidelines**: Responsible lending requirements

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Bias Detection Results
- **Gender Disparity**: 58.2% vs 42.1% approval rates (Male vs Female)
- **Ethnicity Disparity**: 55.9% vs 26.3% approval rates (Caucasian vs African American)
- **Age Disparity**: Significant bias against older applicants
- **Intersectional Effects**: Compounded discrimination for multiple protected groups

### Model Performance Impact
- Biased models show differential performance across groups
- Lower recall rates for disadvantaged groups (higher false negatives)
- Fair models maintain accuracy while reducing bias

### Compliance Violations
- Direct use of protected attributes violates anti-discrimination laws
- Proxy variables create indirect discrimination
- Lack of transparency violates privacy principles

## 🛠️ Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Approaches
1. **Attribute Removal**: Eliminate protected characteristics from models
2. **Fairness Constraints**: Implement demographic parity or equalized odds
3. **Adversarial Debiasing**: Use adversarial training to reduce bias
4. **Post-processing**: Adjust model outputs for fairness

### Organizational Measures
1. **Bias Impact Assessments**: Regular evaluation of model fairness
2. **Ethics Committees**: Establish oversight for AI systems
3. **Staff Training**: Educate teams on algorithmic fairness
4. **External Audits**: Independent verification of model fairness
